## Project: Customer Segmentation and Predictive Modeling for Mail-Order Campaign

## Installations
Ensure you have Python 3.X installed on your system. You can quickly set up the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn==1.2.1
pip install pandas==1.5.3
pip install numpy==1.23.5
pip install matplotlib==3.7.0
pip install seaborn==0.12.2
pip install xgboost==2.0.3
pip install sklearn==1.4.2
```

Consider using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) , a comprehensive Python distribution that comes pre-packaged with all the necessary tools and libraries for this project.

## Project Motivation
As part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, I undertook a capstone project focused on customer segmentation for Arvato Financial Services. My goal was to leverage data science techniques to meet real-world business needs in targeted marketing within the financial services sector. By analyzing demographic data and comparing customers to the general population, I aimed to identify high-value customers for marketing efforts, applying methodologies like unsupervised learning for segmentation and supervised learning for predictive modeling to deliver actionable insights that enhance customer engagement and improve conversion rates. For more details on my findings, check out my Medium blog post.

### 1) Introduction

This project focuses on customer segmentation and response prediction for marketing campaigns, utilizing demographic data and machine learning techniques.


### 2) Data Description

The datasets used in this project are:
Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv: Demographics data for the general population of Germany.
Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv: Demographics data for customers of the mail-order company.
Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv: Training data for predicting customer responses to marketing campaigns.
Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv: Test data for validation without response labels.


### 3) Exploratory Data Analysis
Initial analysis revealed significant missing values and diverse demographics, which informed our approach to preprocessing and modeling.

### 4) Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps included:
Handling missing values
Feature scaling
One-hot encoding
Outlier removal


### 5) Customer Segmentation
Using PCA and K-means clustering, we identified distinct customer segments, enabling targeted marketing strategies.


### 6) Supervised Learning Model
An XGBoost Regressor was trained to predict customer responses based on demographic features from the training dataset.


### 7) Results and Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using ROC AUC scores, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying potential customers.


### 8) Conclusion
This project successfully identified potential customers and provided insights for optimizing marketing strategies. The predictive model serves as a foundation for future marketing campaigns.


### 9) Future Work
- Feature Engineering: Explore additional demographic features to enhance model performance.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like RandomizedSearchCV for better optimization.
- Cross-Validation: Implement stratified cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- Feedback Loop: Incorporate feedback from campaigns to continuously improve the model.
- Future Data Evaluation: Analyze actual responses when available to refine the model further.
